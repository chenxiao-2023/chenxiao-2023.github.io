I am a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at Baylor University, under the supervision of [Dr. Chen Zhao](https://charliezhaoyinpeng.github.io/homepage/). Before that, I worked as a software engineer for some years. I obtained my Master's degree in Computer Science at the Central China Normal University in 2014, under the guidance of Prof. Xianjun Shen. And I recieved my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the Shijiazhuang Tiedao University in 2011. 

Research Interests
======
When learning Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing, and Data Mining during graduate school, I found that many problems, in reality, could be abstracted into computer science problems by building models and using computer science algorithms, such as the retrieval of vast amounts of information, the use of algorithms to simulate the human brain neural network, and then building human-like machines to realize the work that humans can do, etc., which makes me deeply fascinated. Until now, I still have a strong interest in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning and want to pursue cutting-edge knowledge in this field.
